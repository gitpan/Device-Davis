INSTALLATION

The make test portion of the build is interactive.  You are required to 
supply the path to the tty where your weather station is located.  To install
this module, just do the usual:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note that tests 2 and 3 will fail if your weather station is not connected
and configured for 19200 baud, which is the factory default for the
Vantage Pro.  If you need a different baud rate for your hardware, you will
need to modify the Davis.xs file.

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE

I have also written a  daemon, vanprod, which utilizies this module.
If you choose to use this daemon, you can get it from 
http://www.cpan.org/scripts/index.html

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

I'm not aware of any bugs, but I'd love to hear from you if you find one, 
or even if you don't but decide to use this module.
